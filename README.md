# Understanding the Process of Human-AI Value Alignment: Survey Data

This repository contains the open-source data from the systematic literature review conducted for the paper "Understanding the Process of Human-AI Value Alignment" by Jack McKinlay, Marina De Vos, Janina A. Hoffmann, and Andreas Theodorou.

## Overview

This research analysed 172 papers on value alignment in artificial intelligence through systematic thematic analysis, identifying six core themes that characterise the field. The data exports provided here enable transparency and reproducibility of our qualitative coding process.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes exports from our NVivo qualitative analysis project:

- **Codebook**: The complete hierarchical structure of codes, categories, and themes developed through inductive thematic analysis
- **File List**: Details of all 172 papers included in the systematic review
- **Memos**: Research notes and analytical memos documenting the development of themes and insights throughout the coding process

**Note**: The full NVivo project file itself cannot be included due to file size limitations. However, these exports provide comprehensive documentation of our analytical process.

## Key Findings

Our analysis identified six major themes in value alignment research:

1. **Value Alignment Drivers & Approaches** - Motivations, technical/normative dimensions, and interdisciplinary perspectives
2. **Challenges in Value Alignment** - Expressing priorities and implementing ethical theories
3. **Values in Value Alignment** - Contextualisation, dynamism, and aggregation of values
4. **Cognitive Processes in Humans and AI** - Learning, reasoning, and decision-making with values
5. **Human-Agent Teaming** - Interactions and knowledge sharing between humans and AI
6. **Designing and Developing Value-Aligned Systems** - Design processes, stakeholders, and testing

## Methodology

Our systematic review followed a rigorous process:

- **Database**: Scopus
- **Search period**: Up to November 2023
- **Initial results**: 734 papers
- **Final inclusion**: 172 papers for abstract/introduction/conclusion coding; 85 papers for full-text coding
- **Analysis approach**: Inductive thematic analysis using NVivo
- **Coding**: Single coder with systematic categorisation into themes

Full methodology details, including search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria, are provided in the paper.
